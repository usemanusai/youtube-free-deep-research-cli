### **Table of Contents: Prompt-Driven Documentation with GitHub Copilot**

**I. Introduction & Overview**
    A. Host Introduction: Maxin Soniggov, Senior Solution Engineer at Microsoft
    B. Series: Promptdriven Development
    C. Topic: Automating Documentation with GitHub Copilot
    D. Core Promise: Turning documentation from a chore into a fast, accurate process.

**II. The Starting Point: The Example Project**
    A. Project Name: Personal Expense Tracker App
    B. Project State:
        1. Built with a PRD and Technical Specification.
        2. Partially implemented with help from GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.
        3. Simple, incomplete, and lacking documentation (a common hobby project state).

**III. Generating Project-Wide Documentation: The README**
    A. The Goal: Create a comprehensive `README.md` file.
    B. The Method: Using a pre-built community prompt.
    C. Source: The "awesome-copilot" GitHub repository.
    D. Implementation:
        1. Saves the "readme generator" prompt to a local `/Github/prompts` folder.
        2. Follows naming conventions to make it instantly available as a comment.
        3. Executes the prompt in Agent Mode.
    E. Result: A perfectly formatted, complete, and validated README file.

**IV. Documenting the Backend: API Documentation**
    A. The Goal: Create detailed documentation for the API layer.
    B. The Method: A new chat session using Edit Mode (to avoid running commands).
    C. The Prompt: Request to create API documentation following best practices.
    D. Results:
        1. A human-readable API documentation file.
        2. A YAML file for OpenAPI specification.
        3. Both are accurate as Copilot scanned the backend code.

**V. Key Feature Demonstration: Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**
    A. Purpose: Greater flexibility, compliance, security, and cost management.
    B. Demonstration:
        1. Accessing the model selector in GitHub Copilot.
        2. Adding a personal API key (e.g., for Google's Gemini).
        3. Switching between models for different tasks.

**VI. Documenting the Frontend: Inline Code Comments**
    A. The Goal: Add documentation to frontend components (e.g., `TransactionList`).
    B. Method 1: Inline Mode
        1. Using Ctrl+I (Windows) and the `/doc` slash command.
        2. Result: Auto-generated JSDoc comments for a single method.
    C. Method 2: Chat Mode
        1. Prompt: Request to add inline documentation to all methods in a specific file (`dashboard.tsx`).
        2. Result: Full file documentation generated in less than a minute.

**VII. Summary of Best Practices & Workflow**
    A. Steps Taken:
        1. Used a community prompt from `awesome-copilot` for the README.
        2. Used Edit Mode for backend API documentation.
        3. Used Inline and Chat modes for frontend code documentation.
        4. Leveraged the BYOK feature for model flexibility.
    B. Outcome: Transformed the project from undocumented to developer-friendly.
    C. Final Takeaway: GitHub Copilot is a powerful documentation assistant, not just an autocomplete tool.

**VIII. Conclusion & Call to Action**
    A. Encouragement to try the approach on personal projects.
    B. Advice: Start small and refine prompts.
    C. Closing: Thanks and preview of the next episode.
