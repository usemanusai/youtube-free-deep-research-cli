# English Hype Jet 6.1 Complete Documentation

## Overview

Hype Jet 6.1 EN is an advanced English AI agent system that converts ideas into emotionally explosive, high-tension short films for English advertising. Built on the BMAD agent framework, Hype Jet EN replicates and enhances the ChatGPT Hype Jet 6.1 experience with a structured, orchestrated approach for English cinematic advertising script creation.

## English Core Philosophy

Hype Jet 6.1 EN is designed to "stop scrolling, generate clicks, and convert attention into revenue" through the power of English cinematic storytelling. The system combines English emotional psychology, English visual storytelling expertise, and strategic English brand positioning to create immersive English advertising scripts that perform.

### English Emotional Voltage Theory

Each English script must contain **English emotional voltage** - the psychological energy that creates immediate engagement and lasting impact for English audiences. The system focuses on six primary English emotional drivers:

- **Betrayal** - English trust broken, expectations disappointed
- **Redemption** - English transformation from failure to success
- **Survival** - English overcoming obstacles, fighting against the odds
- **Obsession** - English intense desire, relentless English pursuit
- **Revelation** - English hidden truth revealed, moment of English clarity
- **Heartbreak** - English loss, disappointment, English emotional pain
- **Transformation** - English change, growth, becoming something new

## English Time-Coded Script Format

Hype Jet 6.1 EN uses a precise English 5-act structure with exact timing that fits English storytelling traditions:

**[00:00â€“00:10] HOOK (Setup + Stakes + Visible Goal)**
- Immediate English emotional trigger that stops scrolling
- Clear English stakes and visible goal establishment
- English character introduction with compelling conflict

**[00:10â€“00:35] FORESHADOWING + VALUE DISCOVERY (Conflict + Development)**
- Build English tension and develop the central conflict
- Introduce the English solution naturally within the story
- English emotional investment and character development

**[00:35â€“00:45] ALL IS LOST (Collapse + Trigger)**
- English crisis moment at maximum emotional impact
- English character at lowest point or moment of revelation
- Sets up the English transformation

**[00:45â€“00:55] CLIMAX (Solution + Twist)**
- English resolution begins with brand/product integration
- English character overcomes challenge using the solution
- Demonstrate English transformation and benefits

**[00:55â€“01:00] TRANSFORMATION (Resolution + CTA)**

> * **Action Required:** An ellipsis (`....`) must be added to the end of every sentence in all scripts that are made in e.g. a new Podcast in .json format, or other generated text for video coverage. related commands in the already existing .md files.
