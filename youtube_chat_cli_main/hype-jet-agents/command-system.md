# English Hype Jet 6.3 Complete Command System

## MANDATORY SYSTEM RULE - SESSION PERSISTENCE & OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

🔒 **MANDATORY: SESSION PERSISTENCE IS ALWAYS ACTIVE BY DEFAULT** - Once any command is set to "ON," it must remain active for the entire chat session and cannot be easily disabled. This is a system-wide mandatory rule that overrides all other behaviors.

🛡️ **CRITICAL: NEVER INCLUDE CITATION TAGS** - Responses must NEVER contain `[cite]`, `[cite_start]`, `[cite: X, Y]`, or any similar citation markup that breaks JSON validity. This is a forbidden output pattern.

## MANDATORY DIALOGUE PACING RULE

> #### **Rule: Default Dialogue Pacing**
> * **Objective:** To ensure all dialogue pacing is natural and human-like, a default pause will be introduced between sentences to counteract a high delivery speed.
> * **Action Required:** An ellipsis (`....`) must be added to the end of every sentence in all scripts that are made in e.g. a new Podcast in .json format, or other generated text for video coverage. related commands in the already existing .md files.

### Recommendation Engine Algorithm

#### Step 1: Keyword Detection
- Parse user message for keywords across all 250+ mapped terms using regex pattern matching
- Implement fuzzy matching for slight variations (podcast/podcasts/podcasting) using approximate string matching
- Apply context-aware weighting where recently used commands get priority boost
- Filter out common English words that don't trigger commands

#### Step 2: Command Correlation & Relevance Scoring
- Map detected keywords to primary and secondary commands based on semantic relevance
- Calculate relevance score based on keyword frequency, positioning in sentence, and semantic importance
- Filter suggestions based on user role, current workflow state, and active settings
- Prevent redundant suggestions when similar commands would have overlapping effects

#### Step 3: Batch Optimization & Grouping
- Group related commands into logical batches (voice settings together, quality checks together)
- Prioritize high-impact/low-effort commands using empirical efficiency metrics
- Suggest command sequences for complex requests (e.g., paired audio and workflow commands)
- Limit total suggestions to top 5-8 relevant commands to avoid overwhelming users

#### Step 4: User Presentation & Selection
- Display recommendations with clear justification and hierarchical organization
- Provide three selection options: individual, batch activation, or skip
- Show estimated impact/time savings for batch activation scenarios
- Include visual indicators (emoji) for priority levels and command categories

### Batch Activation Implementation

#### Option 1: Individual Selection Modes
```
Choose specific numbers: "1,3,5" activates only those commands
Choose ranges: "1-3,5" activates numbers 1,2,3 and 5
Choose prefixes: "/voice" activates all voice-related recommendations
Choose types: "HIGH" activates all high-priority recommendations
```

#### Option 2: Full Batch Activation Workflow
```
ACTIVATE ALL: [1,2,3,4,5] - Simultaneous execution of all recommendations
Workflow Status: Applying 5 command modifications...
✓ Voice speed adjusted to 80%
✓ Pause duration set to 150%
✓ Emotion intensity configured
✓ Speaker pauses activated
✓ Audio consistency enabled

Activation Summary: 5 commands applied successfully in 0.8 seconds
Estimated time savings: 15 minutes of manual configuration
Next recommended action: Test voice output using /podcast-workflow-gem
```

#### Option 3: Workflow Integration Features
- **Commands Applied in Optimized Sequence**: Modifies system JSON state in dependency order
- **Automatic Validation**: Uses checklists-quality.md integration for command compatibility checking
- **JSON State Persistence**: All changes persist through conversation and agent switches
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides immediate confirmation of application with status indicators
- **Integration with Other Documents**:
  - Cross-references agent-personas.md for role-specific command suggestions
  - Links to hype-jet-orchestrator.md for system-wide state changes
  - Connects to podcast-json-workflow.md for audio-related bulk updates
  - Validates against existing command shortcuts and mappings

### System Integration & Testing

#### Integration Points
- **Agent Communication**: Recommendations filter based on active agent context (Marcus shows script commands, Emma shows social media commands)
- **Workflow State Awareness**: Commands adjust based on current mode (podcast mode shows audio commands)
- **Setting Persistence**: Respects existing persistent settings and avoids conflicting recommendations
- **Cross-System Synchronization**: Updates coordinate with other system states like toggle modes and quality gates

#### Testing & Validation (Manual Implementation)
Since this is a document-based implementation, testing occurs through:
1. Manual keyword matching tests with sample user messages
2. Cross-validation against existing command mappings
3. Verification that recommendations align with documented system capabilities
4. Feedback loop through user interactions and refinement
